# ShellCheck configuration for AutoShift

# Use bash dialect
shell=bash

# Exclude common warnings that are often intentional in this codebase
# These are style preferences or false positives for this project
disable=SC2086,SC2038,SC2011,SC2064,SC2129,SC2001,SC2034,SC2206,SC2207,SC2094,SC2162,SC2012

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing (often intentional)
# SC2038: Use print0/xargs -0 for non-alphanumeric filenames (no such files in this project)
# SC2011: Use find -print0 | xargs -0 (no special filenames)
# SC2064: Use single quotes in trap (intentional expansion)
# SC2129: Consider using { } >> file (style preference)
# SC2001: Use ${var//search/replace} (sed is clearer for complex patterns)
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (often used in sourced scripts)
# SC2206: Quote to prevent word splitting (intentional splitting)
# SC2207: Prefer mapfile/read -a (style preference)
# SC2094: Read/write same file in pipeline (false positive with grep)
# SC2162: read without -r (backslashes not expected)
# SC2012: Use find instead of ls (no special filenames)
#
# FIXED (no longer excluded):
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately - FIXED
# SC2076: Remove quotes from regex - FIXED

# Allow sourcing from paths that may not exist at parse time
