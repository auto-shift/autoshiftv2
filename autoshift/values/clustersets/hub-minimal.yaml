# Minimal AutoShift Configuration
# This file contains the minimum required configuration for AutoShift
# Use this as a starting point and add additional features as needed
#
# IMPORTANT: Operator Label Requirements
# For each enabled operator, you must define ALL of these labels:
#   - {operator}: 'true'                    # Enable the operator
#   - {operator}-subscription-name: '...'   # OLM package name (required for scripts)
#   - {operator}-channel: '...'             # Operator channel
#   - {operator}-source: '...'              # Catalog source (usually redhat-operators)
#   - {operator}-source-namespace: '...'    # Catalog namespace (usually openshift-marketplace)
#
# The subscription-name label is required for:
#   - generate-imageset-config.sh: Detects operators for disconnected mirroring
#   - update-operator-channels.sh: Updates operator channels from catalog
#
# See docs/developer-guide.md for more details on label requirements.

# Minimum Hub Cluster Configuration
hubClusterSets:
  hub:
    labels:
      # Required: OpenShift version for image mirroring and compatibility
      openshift-version: '4.20.12'

      # Required: Indicates this is a self-managed hub cluster
      self-managed: 'true'

      ### OpenShift GitOps (REQUIRED)
      # GitOps is required to deploy AutoShift itself
      gitops: 'true'
      gitops-subscription-name: openshift-gitops-operator
      gitops-disable-default-argocd: 'true'
      gitops-channel: gitops-1.19
      gitops-source: redhat-operators
      gitops-source-namespace: openshift-marketplace
      # gitops-namespace: 'openshift-gitops'  # Override ArgoCD namespace per-cluster

      ### Advanced Cluster Management (AUTOMATIC)
      # ACM is automatically installed on all hub clustersets by policy
      acm-subscription-name: advanced-cluster-management
      acm-channel: release-2.15
      acm-source: redhat-operators
      acm-source-namespace: openshift-marketplace
